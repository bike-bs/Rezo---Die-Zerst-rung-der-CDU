1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, its again time for such a video.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Today we look at the CDU

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,350
also a bit on SPD and AFD

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,350
but primarily we look at the CDU.

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,650
In the last few weeks, I and TJ, we cherry-picked some interesting topics

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,000
and looked, what's the CDU doing there.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,250
What's their opinion?

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,000
To tell the truth:

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Fuck is that heavy.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
I didn't know, that it's so heavy.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
In this video, I will show,

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
how CDU-members are lying,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
the lack of fundamental competences needed for their job,

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
how they doing politics against expert opinions,

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,450
how they evidently participate at different war crimes,

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,200
how they use propaganda and falsehoods against the young generation,

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
how the rich are benefiting from their politic over the last decades

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,900
and how the others lose more and more

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,100
and I will show

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
that, according to the expert opinion of thousands of german scientists,

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,600
the CDU, contemporary, is destroying our live and our future.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,900
As I always do, I will proof all that in detail.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,500
You know, when I'm doing such a video, I'm doing it well..

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,450
Next weekend are the EU-elections.

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,700
I hope you all will vote

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,150
I won't only refer to EU-politics

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,650
because EU-politics is fucking boring * at least often *

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,800
and above all you can't easily separate it.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
If you vote for a party at EU-level

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,150
than you are bolstering them on national level.

31
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,600
So you can't separate that.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,500
This video isn't going to be a boring political video.

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,100
This time, it's going to be a destruction-video.

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Not because I'm actively trying to destroy someone,

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,600
but because the facts are supporting,

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
that the CDU is destroying themselves, their reputation and their election result.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
First, we look at the result of decades of CDU-intensive politics

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,900
and who is benefiting.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,900
* winners and losers *

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
Two things before the start:

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
1. If I'm saying CDU in this video,

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm meaning CDU and/or CSU.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,300
The CSU is, in simple terms, the Bavarian CDU.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,550
Together they are forming the "Union"-party.

45
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,650
Because it's easier, I'm calling them CDU.

46
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,900
2. I have so fucking many proofs in this video,

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,400
that I'm not shortening them

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,250
to an abbreviation,

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,100
like here,

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,900
and in the description is a list with sources, identified by the abbreviations

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Let's start.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
* For whom is the CDU doing politics? *

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,950
For whom is the CDU doing actually politics?

54
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,800
On their homepage they are stating,

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
that they are doing politics for all classes

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
and that they are the people's party of the political center. * <b>Self-conception of the CDU</b> - The Christian Democratic Union is the <b>peoples party of the political center</b>. We address people from all <b>classes and groups from our country.</b> The basis for our is the Christian understanding of humans *

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
But are they that really?

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Lets check that.

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
In the last 36 years, the CDU was 29 years in power.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
That means: If the were good

61
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,400
doing politics for all classes of society

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
we should notice that in statistics.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,700
In this period the gap between rich and poor widened.

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
* As you can see, the SPD-governed years weren't better * The poorest 50% have less and less money

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
and the richest 10% more and more money.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,500
* Development of poverty and economy 2006-2013 * In addition the poverty in Germany increased is increasing constantly in recent years.

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,100
and it doesn't look like it's changing in the near future.

68
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
In addition, most of the rich doesn't get rich by working hard,

69
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,650
but by inheritances and gifts.

70
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,050
So the children of rich parents simply inherit good - and done.

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,400
A few decades ago, it was different.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
their wealth was elaborated by themselves.

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
That's different now.

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Today, the most isn't elaborated by themselves,

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
but comes by a lucky inheritance.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Fun fact:

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,500
The 45 richest private households

78
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,100
the same asset as the poorest 50%. * Distribution of assets in Germany *

79
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,800
That are over 40 people.

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
Such things didn't happen random.

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,300
The government,

82
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
in this period especially the CDU,

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
has many capabilities

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
to influence such things.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,950
For example, the prerequisites were adjusted

86
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,950
so that the poor have to bear a higher tax burden than 20 years ago.

87
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,950
* change of tax burden of different income groups 2015 vs 1998 * And the rich people have to bear less tax burden than 20 years ago.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,750
Obviously such adjustments contribute to such developments.

89
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,650
In the last decades, the super rich have benefited from CDU

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,300
where as the poor lost.

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
But ey: CDU - the party for all classes.

92
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Equal opportunities are one of the most important things of growing inequality.

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,700
That means: What you achieve in your live

94
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,400
shouldn't depend on your parent's wealth, educational level or anything else.

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,500
So even if you're from a poorer household,

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
you should have, through education and such things,

97
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
the same chances as everyone else, to get rich

98
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,400
or get a good job.

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
The problem is: promotion prospects through education

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,800
is in Germany much lower than in most other industrial countries.

101
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
In the PISA study, we lost in categories like

102
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,650
social background or migrant background.

103
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,850
This stresses the unfairness.

104
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,550
That means: In Germany

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,350
you are getting rich, if your father * or your mother * is rich.

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,350
But ey: CDU - a party for all classes.

107
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,850
While we are on education:

108
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,550
Germany spends categorical less money on education then other industrial countries. * Germany spends comparatively little on education - Education spending in percent of GDP 2015 *

109
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,650
So we are below the average.

110
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,650
Even though much associations and institutions

111
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,100
are demanding much more money for education,

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
because we have, for example, an extreme teacher shortage

113
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
and our schools are falling apart.

114
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,550
Now one could say: Education depends on the federal state.

115
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,800
Correct, but in the federal states, where the CDU is in the government,

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
is spend less money per pupil on education

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
than in other federal states. * Expenditures per pupil *

118
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
Great, CDU, great.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
But OK, Merkel has now announced

120
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,600
to spend 10% of the GDP on education and research.

121
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,300
Oh, she wanted to do that until 2015?

122
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,500
She didn't stuck to it? Not even half? * before 8,4% ; status as of 2015 ; target 2015 10% *

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Wow, there is someone really good in managing things.

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,500
Conclusion: In the last decades, the CDU had the most power

125
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,600
and the result is,

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,100
that lots of things developed good

127
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
and for all other not so good.

128
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,800
That's sober seen the result of the course of the CDU.

129
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Education doesn't have a high priority for them.

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
That's also not a rating, but a sober conclusion of the data.

131
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,800
But ey: CDU - a party for all classes.

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, let's finish with the economic topic.

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Economy is a little bit boring.

134
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,400
Do you know, what's exciting? Living.

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
I love to live.

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,800
I need a lot for living.

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,300
But above all, the most important is a functioning earth.

138
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
The next topic is climate.

139
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,800
A few weeks ago, I thought global warming isn't going to be optimal,

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
but it's not going to get crap.

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
Than I researched.

142
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,100
And what I found out, was fucking heavy.

143
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
* The climate crisis - How the CDU destroys our life *

144
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Some might say: This title,

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
CDU is destroying our live, that's exaggerated a little bit.

146
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Yes, a few weeks ago, I have thought so, too.

147
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,150
The majority of experts and scientists

148
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,300
are sharing this exact opinion and can proof this pretty good.

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,100
But before we look at their proofs for the failure of CDU and SPD,

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
we have to clarify the current status.

151
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
* The current status *

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,700
It's going to be hot. 2018 was the fourth warmest year since records began.

153
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Now, you maybe say: The fourth warmest? Than there were three years warmer.

154
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,700
Yes. Do you know which? 2015, 2016 and 2017.

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
That means: The last four years

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,600
were the four warmest years in history. lol.

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,700
The consequences are quite clear.

158
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,800
Due to global warming natural disasters are on the rise,

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
their consequences and dimensions are on the rise.

160
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
This costs currently directly hundreds of billions per year.

161
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,000
Whole regions are sunk already.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because of this, there are lots of millions of refugees,

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
who have lost their home and have to be accommodated anywhere else.

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
A few weeks age, Ju was in Bangladesh

165
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,900
and spoke with such people.

166
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
That was part of his video.

167
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,700
Furthermore species are becoming extinct hundred times faster.

168
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,200
We lose complete habitats, like coral reefs.

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Biologists are saying, that a new mass extinction is probable.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
The last one was 66 million years ago.

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Then an asteroid with the size of a large city crashed on earth.

172
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Today we are able to do it alone.

173
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
That all happened,

174
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,300
because it got in average one degree warmer.

175
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,200
That would remain so for hundreds or thousands of years,

176
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,500
even if mankind would stop burning fuel and coal tomorrow.

177
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And who is thinking: Do one or two degrees  make such a huge difference?

178
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I can say them: Yes, they do.

179
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
Or in different words:

180
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Many are thinking: one degree, two degree, three degree - What's the difference?

181
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,100
As physician I can say you: It's making a huge difference, if you have 41 degree fever or 43 degree fever.

182
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
The first one is compatible with life, the second one not.

183
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
OK, that' the current status.

184
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
But, who is to blame for that?

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
* Who is to blame? *

186
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm not going into physical details.

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Primarily this is happening through CO2 and methane. * Share of different gases on global warming - <font color="#179ad2">CO2</font>, <font color="#be085c">methane</font>, <font color="#0b8729">other</font> *

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
The more of this gases is in atmosphere, the warmer it's going to be.

189
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Methane is produced primarily by industrial animal husbandry .

190
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
Due to the lack of time, I won't talking about methane,

191
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
because CO2 is the largest factor for global warming.

192
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,100
Because of that I'm explaining primarily that.

193
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,400
CO2 is a little part of the air

194
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,900
and that's no problem.

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,200
Leaves, for example, absorb CO2 and emit CO2, for example when they rot.

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,100
That means: There exists different points in nature, where CO2 is emitted.

197
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,400
But, that was previously absorbed from air.

198
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,300
That means: There is not more CO2 in the world due to rotting leaves.

199
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,700
If it rains, there is not suddenly more water in the world.

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
That are natural cycles

201
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,000
and the amount of CO2 allways remains the same.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because of that, the amount of CO2

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
remained quite the same.

204
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,100
So the problem is not, that CO2 exists, but that it increases.

205
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,200
Who to blame?

206
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
We. Completely.

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
The rise of carbon dioxide in atmosphere,

208
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
which is now at 75%,

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
is 100% caused by humans.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
That's completely indisputable in science.

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Primarily we are doing this by digging for coal, oil and natural gas and burning it.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,300
That's inside this and so this shit gets into the air.

213
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,000
That means:  Global warming is caused by 100% by humans.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
And we still have the power to simply stop this.

215
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Above all by stopping the digging and burning.

216
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
And now there are, by 100%, some people among you,

217
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,400
who are saying: Eh, I've heard:

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,700
There is a bit scientific disagreement about that.

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not so sure... Is mankind so hard to blame for... Do they agree on...

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes, OK. Let's look, how agreed they are.

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
tHE scIenCe doEs'nT agReE

222
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I've asked this question to climate scientists.

223
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,900
So I called this Institutes

224
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,000
and they said: Ey, there is no serious scientist

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
who is arguing the converse.

226
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I: Really?

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,600
And they: Yes, there are maybe some, who were payed by oil industry,

228
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
but normally no serious scientist will do that.

229
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,500
And that's in line with the numbers: Only 0.7% of the scientific publications claimed, that mankind isn't to blame for.  * "[...] 0.7 % denied the human caused climate change and 0.3% weren't sure, what's the reason for global warming." *

230
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
Further analysis showed:

231
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,700
That are individual persons who are publishing this.

232
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,200
There exists no reputable institutes or national academies who claim this. * "Not one national academy desputes or denies the scientific consensus regarding the human caused climate change" *

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Not a fucking single one.

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,250
Furthermore studies have shown, that the public extremely underestimates, how big this consensus is.

235
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,350
So how strong the science agrees.

236
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,800
And there are studies showing, that:

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,100
The sooner you say: "Mankind isn't to blame for climate change.",

238
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
the sooner you don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
So, realtalk:

240
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Before my research, I didn't know how big this consensus is.

241
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,100
I thought, something like 98, 97%. But no, it is more and unbelievable clear.

242
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,200
The AFD is the only political party, who denies this.

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes. Did you thought, They get nothing?

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
No, no. Nobody should draw wrong conclusions from this video

245
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,800
and think, the AFD could be a legit option.

246
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,500
They aren't. Not only, because there are Nazis, but also, because they aren't cognitive impressive.

247
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,700
They seriously think, that the thousands of scientists on the world aren't serious.

248
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Sometimes, they say, that the scientist are lying, that's not correct, what the scientists are saying.

249
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
And mankind isn't to blame for climate change.

250
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,300
Because climate change isn't caused by mankind. * Speaker for science and finance of the parliamentary group of the AFD *

251
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,000
This woman claims, that global warming is maybe caused by sun. Maybe the sun is shining stronger.

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Maybe the thousands of climate scientists didn't have done their job correctly and never examined this.

253
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:25,500
News flash: I've literally googled this one minute and found various papers who examined this and found out the opposite. * "Since 1940 the activity of the sun was in average constant, in the last decades  even declining" *

254
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,100
So the sun is shining less strong. lol.

255
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes, you find that funny.

256
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,700
But do you know, whats even more funny?

257
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,000
On the question of weather that should be a stronger reason for doing something against climate change, she answers:

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,900
We should explain to the sun, that she should shine less, for example.

259
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,800
That would be a consideration, because the sun has an effect to the oceans and not we onto the oceans, but the sun.

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,500
Now the few AFD voters following me are rightly ashamed.

261
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,600
But, it's not bad. You're responsible for her sitting in the German parliament

262
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,700
and making us happy with such wisdom, but you don't need to repeat your mistake.

263
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,500
Than nobody is angry at you.

264
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
But, what about the CDU?

265
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,600
Well, they are surely more compentent?

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,400
They wouldn't simply ignore clear scientific facts and an overwhelming consensus about necessary behaviour?

267
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Didn't they?

268
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Well, before going into this, we have to look shortly on what the science is saying, in addition to blame mankind.

269
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
* What do we have to do? *

270
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,600
Because of the global rise of average 1°C, all the catastrophes came.

271
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,200
The scientific community  agrees that we must not exceed 1.5°C.

272
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,700
If we exceed 1.5°C it is extremely likely that we are getting into a feedback loop.

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,050
In this case it is getting warmer, no matter what we are doing.

274
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,850
That's then irreversible - You can't undo that.

275
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,800
In other words: We would have destroyed earth.

276
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,900
The world is fucked up for your children, grandchildren and even for your great great great great great grandchildren.

277
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,000
They wold never again see the earth like we have got familiar with.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,700
Or saying it with a scientific slang:

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:07,400
The irreversibility of the change of ecological systems in their regeneration, in my opinion, haven't been understood.

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,000
How is earth looking like, if we get into this feedback loop?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,100
Well, because of the lost of their homes, 100 millions of people have to flee.

282
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:25,100
A few years ago, the International Organization for Migration has calculated, that in 30 years 230 million people have to find accomodation in different countries.

283
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Since then we weren't on such a good course.

284
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Because of that, the IOM assumes, that there will be over 400 million displaced persons.

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Only for an order of magnitude:

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
There are living 500 million people in the EU.

287
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Only that you know that.

288
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
So many people will come and many of them to europe.

289
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,400
So, if you believe, that the refugees in recent years were a "refugee crisis", you can look forward to this.

290
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,500
Then there won't be a few million people, but there will be hundreds of millions of people.

291
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
And you won't be able to say to them:

292
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
Rebuild your home.

293
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
This would not be possible anymore.

294
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,200
You remember:

295
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Irreversability

296
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
So: No reconstruction and no roll back.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So: The earth will get warmer and warmer and we cannot do something against that.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,400
There will be increasingly grosser and stronger natural catastrophes.

299
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,550
The food suply in lots of countries will go out.

300
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,950
Probably there will be more wars on ressources.

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,800
The announced mass extinction would no longer be stoppable.

302
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
But not only animals are dying.

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,100
We will also receive a little goodie bag.

304
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
There will be more diseases for us.

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,200
Most of all more infectious diseases and allergies.

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Yippee.

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Ok, it sound's like this topic should have an inconceivable high priority for every politician.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,700
But, can we still change this?

309
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,200
* What can we do? *
