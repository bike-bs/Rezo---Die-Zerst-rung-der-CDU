1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, its again time for such a video.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Today we look at the CDU

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,350
also a bit on SPD and AFD

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,350
but primarily we look at the CDU

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,650
In the last few weeks, I and TJ, we cherry-picked some interesting topics

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,000
and looked, what's the CDU doing there.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,250
What's their opinion?

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,000
To tell the truth:

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Fuck is that heavy.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
I didn't know, that it's so heavy.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
In this video, I will show,

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
how CDU-members are lying,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
the lack of fundamental competences needed for their job,

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
how they doing politics against expert opinions,

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,450
how they evidently participate at different war crimes,

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,200
how they use propaganda and falsehoods against the young generation,

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
how the rich are benefiting from their politic over the last decades

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,900
and how the others lose more and more

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,100
and I will show

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
that, according to the expert opinion of thousands of german scientists,

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,600
the CDU, contemporary, is destroying our live and our future.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,900
As I always do, I will proof all that in detail.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,500
You know, when I'm doing such a video, I'm doing it well..

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,450
Next weekend are the EU-elections.

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,700
I hope you all will vote

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,150
I won't only refer to EU-politics

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,650
because EU-politics is fucking boring * at least often *

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,800
and above all you can't easily separate it.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
If you vote for a party at EU-level

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,150
than you are bolstering them on national level.

31
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,600
So you can't separate that.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,500
This video isn't going to be a boring political video.

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,100
This time, it's going to be a destruction-video.

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Not because I'm actively trying to destroy someone,

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,600
but because the facts are supporting,

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
that the CDU is destroying themselves, their reputation and their election result.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
First, we look at the result of decades of CDU-intensive politics

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,900
and who is benefiting.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,900
* winners and losers *

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
Two things before the start:

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
1. If I'm saying CDU in this video,

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm meaning CDU and/or CSU.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,300
The CSU is, in simple terms, the Bavarian CDU.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,550
Together they are forming the "Union"-party.

45
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,650
Because it's easier, I'm calling them CDU.

46
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,900
2. I have so fucking many proofs in this video,

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,400
that I'm not shortening them

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,250
to an abbreviation,

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,100
like here,

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,900
and in the description is a list with sources, identified by the abbreviations

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Let's start.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
* For whom is the CDU doing politics? *

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,950
For whom is the CDU doing actually politics?

54
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,800
On their homepage they are stating,

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
that they are doing politics for all classes

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
and that they are the people's party of the political center. * <b>Self-conception of the CDU</b> - The Christian Democratic Union is the <b>peoples party of the political center</b>. We address people from all <b>classes and groups from our country.</b> The basis for our is the Christian understanding of humans *

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
But are they that really?

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Lets check that.

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
In the last 36 years, the CDU was 29 years in power.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
That means: If the were good

61
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,400
doing politics for all classes of society

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
we should notice that in statistics.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,700
In this period the gap between rich and poor widened.

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
* As you can see, the SPD-governed years weren't better * The poorest 50% have less and less money

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
and the richest 10% more and more money.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,500
* Development of poverty and economy 2006-2013 * In addition the poverty in Germany increased is increasing constantly in recent years.

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,100
and it doesn't look like it's changing in the near future.

68
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
In addition, most of the rich doesn't get rich by working hard,

69
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,650
but by inheritances and gifts.

70
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,050
So the children of rich parents simply inherit good - and done.

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,400
A few decades ago, it was different.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
their wealth was elaborated by themselves.

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
That's different now.

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Today, the most isn't elaborated by themselves,

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
but comes by a lucky inheritance.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Fun fact:

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,500
The 45 richest private households

78
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,100
the same asset as the poorest 50%. * Distribution of assets in Germany *

79
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,800
That are over 40 people.

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
Such things didn't happen random.

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,300
The government,

82
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
in this period especially the CDU,

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
has many capabilities

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
to influence such things.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,950
For example, the prerequisites were adjusted

86
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,950
so that the poor have to bear a higher tax burden than 20 years ago.

87
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,950
* change of tax burden of different income groups 2015 vs 1998 * And the rich people have to bear less tax burden than 20 years ago.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,750
Obviously such adjustments contribute to such developments.

89
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,650
In the last decades, the super rich have benefited from CDU

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,300
where as the poor lost.

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
But ey: CDU - the party for all classes.
