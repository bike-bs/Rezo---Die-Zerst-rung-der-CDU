1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, its again time for such a video.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,350
Today we look at the CDU

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,350
also a bit on SPD and AFD

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,350
but primarily we look at the CDU.

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,650
In the last few weeks, I and TJ, we cherry-picked some interesting topics

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,000
and looked, what's the CDU doing there.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,250
What's their opinion?

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,000
To tell the truth:

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Fuck is that heavy.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
I didn't know, that it's so heavy.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
In this video, I will show,

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
how CDU-members are lying,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
the lack of fundamental competences needed for their job,

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
how they doing politics against expert opinions,

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,450
how they evidently participate at different war crimes,

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,200
how they use propaganda and falsehoods against the young generation,

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
how the rich are benefiting from their politic over the last decades

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,900
and how the others lose more and more

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,100
and I will show

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
that, according to the expert opinion of thousands of german scientists,

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,600
the CDU, contemporary, is destroying our live and our future.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,900
As I always do, I will proof all that in detail.

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,500
You know, when I'm doing such a video, I'm doing it well..

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,450
Next weekend are the EU-elections.

25
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,700
I hope you all will vote

26
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,150
I won't only refer to EU-politics

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,650
because EU-politics is fucking boring * at least often *

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,800
and above all you can't easily separate it.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
If you vote for a party at EU-level

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,150
than you are bolstering them on national level.

31
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,600
So you can't separate that.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,500
This video isn't going to be a boring political video.

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,100
This time, it's going to be a destruction-video.

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Not because I'm actively trying to destroy someone,

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,600
but because the facts are supporting,

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
that the CDU is destroying themselves, their reputation and their election result.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
First, we look at the result of decades of CDU-intensive politics

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,900
and who is benefiting.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,900
* winners and losers *

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
Two things before the start:

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
1. If I'm saying CDU in this video,

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm meaning CDU and/or CSU.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,300
The CSU is, in simple terms, the Bavarian CDU.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,550
Together they are forming the "Union"-party.

45
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,650
Because it's easier, I'm calling them CDU.

46
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,900
2. I have so fucking many proofs in this video,

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,400
that I'm not shortening them

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,250
to an abbreviation,

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,100
like here,

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,900
and in the description is a list with sources, identified by the abbreviations

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Let's start.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
* For whom is the CDU doing politics? *

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,950
For whom is the CDU doing actually politics?

54
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,800
On their homepage they are stating,

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
that they are doing politics for all classes

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
and that they are the people's party of the political center. * <b>Self-conception of the CDU</b> - The Christian Democratic Union is the <b>peoples party of the political center</b>. We address people from all <b>classes and groups from our country.</b> The basis for our is the Christian understanding of humans *

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
But are they that really?

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Lets check that.

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
In the last 36 years, the CDU was 29 years in power.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,100
That means: If the were good

61
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,400
doing politics for all classes of society

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
we should notice that in statistics.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,700
In this period the gap between rich and poor widened.

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
* As you can see, the SPD-governed years weren't better * The poorest 50% have less and less money

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
and the richest 10% more and more money.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,500
* Development of poverty and economy 2006-2013 * In addition the poverty in Germany increased is increasing constantly in recent years.

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,100
and it doesn't look like it's changing in the near future.

68
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
In addition, most of the rich doesn't get rich by working hard,

69
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,650
but by inheritances and gifts.

70
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,050
So the children of rich parents simply inherit good - and done.

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,400
A few decades ago, it was different.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
their wealth was elaborated by themselves.

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
That's different now.

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Today, the most isn't elaborated by themselves,

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
but comes by a lucky inheritance.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Fun fact:

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,500
The 45 richest private households

78
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,100
the same asset as the poorest 50%. * Distribution of assets in Germany *

79
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,800
That are over 40 people.

80
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
Such things didn't happen random.

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,300
The government,

82
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
in this period especially the CDU,

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
has many capabilities

84
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
to influence such things.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,950
For example, the prerequisites were adjusted

86
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,950
so that the poor have to bear a higher tax burden than 20 years ago.

87
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,950
* change of tax burden of different income groups 2015 vs 1998 * And the rich people have to bear less tax burden than 20 years ago.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,750
Obviously such adjustments contribute to such developments.

89
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,650
In the last decades, the super rich have benefited from CDU

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,300
where as the poor lost.

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,900
But ey: CDU - the party for all classes.

92
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Equal opportunities are one of the most important things of growing inequality.

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,700
That means: What you achieve in your live

94
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,400
shouldn't depend on your parent's wealth, educational level or anything else.

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,500
So even if you're from a poorer household,

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
you should have, through education and such things,

97
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
the same chances as everyone else, to get rich

98
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,400
or get a good job.

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
The problem is: promotion prospects through education

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,800
is in Germany much lower than in most other industrial countries.

101
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
In the PISA study, we lost in categories like

102
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,650
social background or migrant background.

103
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,850
This stresses the unfairness.

104
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,550
That means: In Germany

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,350
you are getting rich, if your father * or your mother * is rich.

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,350
But ey: CDU - a party for all classes.

107
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,850
While we are on education:

108
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,550
Germany spends categorical less money on education then other industrial countries. * Germany spends comparatively little on education - Education spending in percent of GDP 2015 *

109
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,650
So we are below the average.

110
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,650
Even though much associations and institutions

111
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,100
are demanding much more money for education,

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
because we have, for example, an extreme teacher shortage

113
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
and our schools are falling apart.

114
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,550
Now one could say: Education depends on the federal state.

115
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,800
Correct, but in the federal states, where the CDU is in the government,

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
is spend less money per pupil on education

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
than in other federal states. * Expenditures per pupil *

118
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
Great, CDU, great.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
But OK, Merkel has now announced

120
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,600
to spend 10% of the GDP on education and research.

121
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,300
Oh, she wanted to do that until 2015?

122
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,500
She didn't stuck to it? Not even half? * before 8,4% ; status as of 2015 ; target 2015 10% *

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Wow, there is someone really good in managing things.

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,500
Conclusion: In the last decades, the CDU had the most power

125
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,600
and the result is,

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,100
that lots of things developed good

127
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
and for all other not so good.

128
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,800
That's sober seen the result of the course of the CDU.

129
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Education doesn't have a high priority for them.

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
That's also not a rating, but a sober conclusion of the data.

131
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,800
But ey: CDU - a party for all classes.

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, let's finish with the economic topic.

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
Economy is a little bit boring.

134
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,400
Do you know, what's exciting? Living.

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
I love to live.

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,800
I need a lot for living.

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,300
But above all, the most important is a functioning earth.

138
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
The next topic is climate.

139
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,800
A few weeks ago, I thought global warming isn't going to be optimal,

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
but it's not going to get crap.

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
Than I researched.

142
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,100
And what I found out, was fucking heavy.

143
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
* The climate crisis - How the CDU destroys our life *

144
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Some might say: This title,

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
CDU is destroying our live, that's exaggerated a little bit.

146
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Yes, a few weeks ago, I have thought so, too.

147
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,150
The majority of experts and scientists

148
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,300
are sharing this exact opinion and can proof this pretty good.

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,100
But before we look at their proofs for the failure of CDU and SPD,

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
we have to clarify the current status.

151
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
* The current status *

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,700
It's going to be hot. 2018 was the fourth warmest year since records began.

153
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Now, you maybe say: The fourth warmest? Than there were three years warmer.

154
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,700
Yes. Do you know which? 2015, 2016 and 2017.

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
That means: The last four years

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,600
were the four warmest years in history. lol.

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,700
The consequences are quite clear.

158
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,800
Due to global warming natural disasters are on the rise,

159
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
their consequences and dimensions are on the rise.

160
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
This costs currently directly hundreds of billions per year.

161
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,000
Whole regions are sunk already.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because of this, there are lots of millions of refugees,

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
who have lost their home and have to be accommodated anywhere else.

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
A few weeks age, Ju was in Bangladesh

165
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,900
and spoke with such people.

166
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
That was part of his video.

167
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,700
Furthermore species are becoming extinct hundred times faster.

168
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,200
We lose complete habitats, like coral reefs.

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Biologists are saying, that a new mass extinction is probable.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
The last one was 66 million years ago.

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Then an asteroid with the size of a large city crashed on earth.

172
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Today we are able to do it alone.

173
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
That all happened,

174
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,300
because it got in average one degree warmer.

175
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,200
That would remain so for hundreds or thousands of years,

176
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,500
even if mankind would stop burning fuel and coal tomorrow.

177
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And who is thinking: Do one or two degrees  make such a huge difference?

178
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I can say them: Yes, they do.

179
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,100
Or in different words:

180
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Many are thinking: one degree, two degree, three degree - What's the difference?

181
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,100
As physician I can say you: It's making a huge difference, if you have 41 degree fever or 43 degree fever.

182
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
The first one is compatible with life, the second one not.

183
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
OK, that' the current status.

184
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
But, who is to blame for that?

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
* Who is to blame? *

186
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm not going into physical details.

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Primarily this is happening through CO2 and methane. * Share of different gases on global warming - <font color="#179ad2">CO2</font>, <font color="#be085c">methane</font>, <font color="#0b8729">other</font> *

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
The more of this gases is in atmosphere, the warmer it's going to be.

189
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
Methane is produced primarily by industrial animal husbandry .

190
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
Due to the lack of time, I won't talking about methane,

191
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
because CO2 is the largest factor for global warming.

192
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,100
Because of that I'm explaining primarily that.

193
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,400
CO2 is a little part of the air

194
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,900
and that's no problem.

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,200
Leaves, for example, absorb CO2 and emit CO2, for example when they rot.

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,100
That means: There exists different points in nature, where CO2 is emitted.

197
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,400
But, that was previously absorbed from air.

198
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,300
That means: There is not more CO2 in the world due to rotting leaves.

199
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,700
If it rains, there is not suddenly more water in the world.

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
That are natural cycles

201
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,000
and the amount of CO2 allways remains the same.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because of that, the amount of CO2

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
remained quite the same.

204
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,100
So the problem is not, that CO2 exists, but that it increases.

205
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,200
Who to blame?

206
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
We. Completely.

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
The rise of carbon dioxide in atmosphere,

208
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
which is now at 75%,

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
is 100% caused by humans.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
That's completely indisputable in science.

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,000
Primarily we are doing this by digging for coal, oil and natural gas and burning it.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,300
That's inside this and so this shit gets into the air.

213
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,000
That means:  Global warming is caused by 100% by humans.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
And we still have the power to simply stop this.

215
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,600
Above all by stopping the digging and burning.

216
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
And now there are, by 100%, some people among you,

217
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,400
who are saying: Eh, I've heard:

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,700
There is a bit scientific disagreement about that.

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not so sure... Is mankind so hard to blame for... Do they agree on...

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes, OK. Let's look, how agreed they are.

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
tHE scIenCe doEs'nT agReE

222
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I've asked this question to climate scientists.

223
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,900
So I called this Institutes

224
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,000
and they said: Ey, there is no serious scientist

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
who is arguing the converse.

226
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I: Really?

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,600
And they: Yes, there are maybe some, who were payed by oil industry,

228
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
but normally no serious scientist will do that.

229
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,500
And that's in line with the numbers: Only 0.7% of the scientific publications claimed, that mankind isn't to blame for.  * "[...] 0.7 % denied the human caused climate change and 0.3% weren't sure, what's the reason for global warming." *

230
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
Further analysis showed:

231
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,700
That are individual persons who are publishing this.

232
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,200
There exists no reputable institutes or national academies who claim this. * "Not one national academy desputes or denies the scientific consensus regarding the human caused climate change" *

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Not a fucking single one.

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,250
Furthermore studies have shown, that the public extremely underestimates, how big this consensus is.

235
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,350
So how strong the science agrees.

236
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,800
And there are studies showing, that:

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,100
The sooner you say: "Mankind isn't to blame for climate change.",

238
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
the sooner you don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
So, realtalk:

240
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Before my research, I didn't know how big this consensus is.

241
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,100
I thought, something like 98, 97%. But no, it is more and unbelievable clear.

242
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,200
The AFD is the only political party, who denies this.

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Yes. Did you thought, They get nothing?

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
No, no. Nobody should draw wrong conclusions from this video

245
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,800
and think, the AFD could be a legit option.

246
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,500
They aren't. Not only, because there are Nazis, but also, because they aren't cognitive impressive.

247
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,700
They seriously think, that the thousands of scientists on the world aren't serious.

248
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Sometimes, they say, that the scientist are lying, that's not correct, what the scientists are saying.

249
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
And mankind isn't to blame for climate change.

250
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,300
Because climate change isn't caused by mankind. * Speaker for science and finance of the parliamentary group of the AFD *

251
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,000
This woman claims, that global warming is maybe caused by sun. Maybe the sun is shining stronger.

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Maybe the thousands of climate scientists didn't have done their job correctly and never examined this.

253
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:25,500
News flash: I've literally googled this one minute and found various papers who examined this and found out the opposite. * "Since 1940 the activity of the sun was in average constant, in the last decades  even declining" *

254
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,100
So the sun is shining less strong. lol.

255
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes, you find that funny.

256
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,700
But do you know, whats even more funny?

257
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,000
On the question of weather that should be a stronger reason for doing something against climate change, she answers:

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,900
We should explain to the sun, that it should shine less, for example.

259
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,800
That would be a consideration, because the sun has an effect to the oceans and not we onto the oceans, but the sun.

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,500
Now the few AFD voters following me are rightly ashamed.

261
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,600
But, it's not bad. You're responsible for her sitting in the German parliament

262
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,700
and making us happy with such wisdom, but you don't need to repeat your mistake.

263
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,500
Than nobody is angry at you.

264
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
But, what about the CDU?

265
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,600
Well, they are surely more compentent?

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,400
They wouldn't simply ignore clear scientific facts and an overwhelming consensus about necessary behaviour?

267
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Didn't they?

268
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Well, before going into this, we have to look shortly on what the science is saying, in addition to blame mankind.

269
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
* What do we have to do? *

270
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,600
Because of the global rise of average 1°C, all the catastrophes came.

271
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,200
The scientific community  agrees that we must not exceed 1.5°C.

272
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,700
If we exceed 1.5°C it is extremely likely that we are getting into a feedback loop.

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,050
In this case it is getting warmer, no matter what we are doing.

274
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,850
That's then irreversible - You can't undo that.

275
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,800
In other words: We would have destroyed earth.

276
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,900
The world is fucked up for your children, grandchildren and even for your great great great great great grandchildren.

277
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,000
They wold never again see the earth like we have got familiar with.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,700
Or saying it with a scientific slang:

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:07,400
The irreversibility of the change of ecological systems in their regeneration, in my opinion, haven't been understood.

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,000
How is earth looking like, if we get into this feedback loop?

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,100
Well, because of the lost of their homes, 100 millions of people have to flee.

282
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:25,100
A few years ago, the International Organization for Migration has calculated, that in 30 years 230 million people have to find accomodation in different countries.

283
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Since then we weren't on such a good course.

284
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Because of that, the IOM assumes, that there will be over 400 million displaced persons.

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Only for an order of magnitude:

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
There are living 500 million people in the EU.

287
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,900
Only that you know that.

288
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
So many people will come and many of them to europe.

289
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,400
So, if you believe, that the refugees in recent years were a "refugee crisis", you can look forward to this.

290
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,500
Then there won't be a few million people, but there will be hundreds of millions of people.

291
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,300
And you won't be able to say to them:

292
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
Rebuild your home.

293
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
This would not be possible anymore.

294
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,200
You remember:

295
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Irreversability

296
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
So: No reconstruction and no roll back.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So: The earth will get warmer and warmer and we cannot do something against that.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,400
There will be increasingly grosser and stronger natural catastrophes.

299
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,550
The food suply in lots of countries will go out.

300
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,950
Probably there will be more wars on ressources.

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,800
The announced mass extinction would no longer be stoppable.

302
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
But not only animals are dying.

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,100
We will also receive a little goodie bag.

304
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
There will be more diseases for us.

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,200
Most of all more infectious diseases and allergies.

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Yippee.

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Ok, it sound's like this topic should have an inconceivable high priority for every politician.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,700
But, can we still change this?

309
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,200
* What can we do? *

310
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,300
Yes. The science is saying that all is possible. We only have to make very different political decisions than in the past.

311
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Scientists have shown that we can switch to renewable energies much faster, even globally.

312
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
The calculations primarily differ in the costs.

313
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,500
According to one group that will be as expensive as the present energy supply. * "The burden for wind/water/solar in the health ans climate sector is 1/4 of the present tack. The energy costs for wind/water/solar are lower or same" *

314
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,900
So: Win situation.

315
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
According to the other group it will be cheaper than the present energy supply. * "The global average energy system levelised cost of electricity gradually declines from 70 €/MWh in 2015 to 52 €/MWh in 2050 throughout the transition period" *

316
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
So: Win-win situation.

317
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:08,600
For the cost situation many studies show that a 100% renewable energy supply isn't more expensive than the conventional energy supply.

318
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,200
The scientists agree that we have to switch to wind, water and especially to solar energy as soon as possible.

319
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,400
And that we obviously have to end coal, oil and such shit as soon as possible.

320
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,600
And if I say end, I mean end. So that's it.

321
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,300
That was very helpful for mankind for a while and that's it. * "Successful [...] scenarios are characterized by a rapid change away from the traditional usage of fossil fuels" *

322
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,800
Yeah. That's great.

323
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,300
Then we could do all this. We could easily manage this transition.

324
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,800
The scientific community has very many solutions.

325
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,900
So CDU and SPD actually only have to implement what the scientists are saying.

326
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
That's nice.

327
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,800
The thing is: They aren't doing this.

328
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
That's so sad.

329
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,100
CDU and SPD don't deny man-made global warming.

330
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,650
Germany has even signed the Paris Agreement.

331
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:57,300
That's an agreement that many many countries have singed. There is written that we have to stay far far below 2°C, best below 1.5°C.

332
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,300
That means, the 1.5 degree, what the scientists are saying, is the official goal of Germany.

333
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,600
But, we don't stick to it.

334
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,000
I will show with an example how far we miss the goal.

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,500
One can calculate that if we want to stick to the 1.5°C the whole mankind is only allowed to release a certain amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

336
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,300
This amount is immutable calculated.

337
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
This amound is fixed. We still have this amount.

338
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,800
How fast we consume this amount is our choice.

339
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,900
We have a lot of time to consume this amount if we significantly reduce our CO2 emissions now.

340
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,400
The truth is: This amount will be consumed in less than nine years with the current tack.

341
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,700
That means not later than in nine years the entire mankind has to stop abruptly flying planes, driving fossil fuel cars or having coal-fired power plants.

342
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,300
All this would have to stop from one day to the next.

343
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,200
But Merkel want's to use coal power until 2038. * "We will phase out of lignite in 2038" *

344
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,800
I don't want to be a spoilsport, but that doesn't meet the Paris Agreement.

345
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,000
By the way, the SPD is in the same boat.

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,300
Their former leader Martin Schulz is answering the question of phasing out lignite before 2038:

347
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,500
(Reporter) Are you in favor of this happening even earlier?

348
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
(Schulz) No. (Reporter) No?

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,900
That mean's: If you thought the SPD probably sides with science and not with the CDU, I have to say: (Schulz) No.

350
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,700
We can't shift the blame on others.

351
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,500
We can't say: We only make very little amounts of CO2, the Chinese are to blame for.

352
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,900
No. We didn't fulfilled our own goals.

353
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,400
So there were intermediate goals and CDU and SPD didn't weren't able to fulfill them.

354
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
OK, I have to shortly toss that:

355
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
A personal short rant beside the facts:

356
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Setting themselves goals and didn't fulfill them, what a incompetent shit!

357
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,700
I would fire them if they would be my employees.

358
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Setting goals and don't fulfill them is not a behavior for a government.

359
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Setting goals and don't fulfill them is something for people who want to lose weight.

360
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,000
For example for customers of Weight Watchers or so. "Oops, today I've overrun my calories, again."

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Setting goals and don't fulfill them is something what we all do at New Year's Eve.

362
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,900
There it's not bad.

363
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
But I didn't have to pay somebody for this.

364
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Everybody can set himself non-binding goals and don't fulfill them. That's no art.

365
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
The government has the ability to make binding laws.

366
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,100
They could make a law which says that coal-fired power plants are forbidden on a given year.

367
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
That would be so. One have to stick to this.

368
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,500
The government isn't doing this.

369
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,600
Instead they are a great fan of setting non-binding goals and saying:

370
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
"Yes, up to now we don't fulfill the goals."

371
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,800
"One don't need to fulfill them. It's not mandatory."

372
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,200
But it would be very cool. It's only about our future.

373
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Ok, I had to toss this. Back to the facts.

374
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe this is because the other countries are slowing us down. Maybe we want more ...

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,600
What?            Oh, other countries start initiatives and want to fight the crises more and we slow them down and don't participate? * When it comes to the major topic of  climate change, Merkel is slammed the brakes: Merkel didn't share ambitious suggestions  from France for fighting against climate change. *

376
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Ok, CDU is slowing down the fight against global warming. But ey, maybe they have a good reason.

377
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,200
That isn't acceptable from an economic point of view. Coal industry is huge in German...

378
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,200
What? Only 20,000 jobs? In the whole coal industry?

379
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Ok, that doesn't sound much, but I mean, a country is unable to withstand the reduction of 20,000 jobs.

380
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
What?

381
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,000
(Quaschning) On the other side, we have shredded 80,000 jobs in the photovoltaics industry in the last four years without turning a hair.

382
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:21,800
This happend, because the government has significantly reduced expansion of renewable energies between 2012 and 2015 due to cost reasons.

383
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:32,300
Um, ok, the CDU and SPD shred 80,000 jobs in an area even existing in decades and adhere 20,000 jobs in an area which will soon no longer exist?

384
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,800
That sounds somehow nonsensical.

385
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,100
Especially because it's absolutely normal that old jobs cease and new jobs arise due to developments and technologies.

386
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:46,800
Due to the digitization hundreds of thousands of jobs are ceasing. But despite that nobody says: Let's rescue the typewriter industry, please.

387
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,000
What does scientist say to this different treatment?

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Why can one be celebrated as advancement

389
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,900
 - with all the collateral damages, for which the politics and the society naturally of course should stand accountable -

390
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,000
and the other is averted until the last moment even though it is in proportionality about an other order of magnitude.

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,100
Well, that doesn't sounds so nice.

392
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,900
This scientist also says at this point that the question, why this is so absurd, can only be answered with interests and power constellations. * " That can only be answered through political-economical questions concerning interests and and power constellations." *

393
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:23,300
In other words: That's economically bullshit, ecologically bullshit but some very rich people benefit from a late phase out of coal.

394
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Who might be that?

395
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Maybe coal companies?

396
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,600
What a coincidence that RWE was discovered frequently by shifting money to members of CDU.

397
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,100
It happened that CDU lawmakers got 100,000€ alongside their mandate.

398
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,600
Or different local politicians sometimes get 600,000€ or so. * Perquisites  - RWE sponsors over hundred local politicians - Not only leading politicians are on  the payrolls of large corporations. The energy group RWE payd also to a number of local officials and elected representatives. All in all more than 600,000€ are spend for this yearly. *

399
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,700
One can do that.

400
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,000
But why are they doing that?

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Are they simply patronizing?

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,800
Or do they expect a return from the CDU?

403
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,300
How could such a return look like?

404
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, slowing down the phase out of coal is definitely nice.

405
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
But do you know, what's much cooler?

406
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,300
If the CDU would have ensured that billions of taxpayers' money will flow to the coal dudes. * "The domestic mining industry only was able to survive due to billions of government subsidies." *

407
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
That would be nice.

408
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,200
Oops. So it was not only spend less money for urgently needed technologies, * "The [...] goverment subsidies for lignite mining and usage sum up to round about 4.5 billion Euro per year." *

409
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,100
but coal mining - which we have to end as soon as possible - was artificially kept alive even though coal mining i economically unfeasible? * "The coal production in Germany is subsidized because it isn't internationally  competitive." *

410
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
So the coal-fired energy production is actually lost-maker.

411
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,600
Especially if you include the caused damages. * Generation of one kilowatt hour - 3 Cent RWE revenue - 19 Cent health and environmental damage *

412
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,000
There the bosses are earning their big salaries because we taxpayers are paying that.

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,700
We pay billions.

414
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,800
That means the CDU is actually destroying our environment with taxpayers' money.

415
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,900
That's the opposite of which they should do.

416
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,300
Ok, ok. Maybe I'm thinking to much in the short-term.

417
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Is the tack of CDU and SPD maybe economically reasonable in long-term?

418
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Hm, well, not really.

419
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:51,400
To be brief: The consensus of all current scientific investigations - that are thousands - was summarized last year from the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

420
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,200
According to this we fuck up hardly and will reach round about 3°C. * "Scenarios which simulate the national efforts until 2030 are resulting in a global warming of round about 3°C with  additional subsequent warming." *

421
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
That means we would activate the feedback loops and it will get warmer and warmer.

422
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,300
And than the economically damage will be incredibly high.

423
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,600
We globally aren't speaking of millions or billions - we are speaking of trillions.

424
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,400
One trillion is, if you have one million friends with each having one million Euros.

425
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
And if they all throw it onto one heap - that's one trillion.

426
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,800
And we would have to spend innumerable of such heaps.

427
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,400
lol

428
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,600
That means in short-term and especally in long-term is the current tack an economical catastrophe.

429
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,800
Or in other words: It's cheaper if we would protect the environment much more.

430
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,100
Yes, ok. So SPD and CDU are holding the coal power artificially at life.

431
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,200
This doesn't bring anybody anything except the few coal dudes.

432
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,100
This is because the CDU shifts a lot of taxpayers' money to them and because they sometimes give something with pleasure back to the CDU.

433
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,800
Yes, that's proven.

434
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,100
Stop, there might be an alternative. There is something different one can do.

435
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Yes, it is.

436
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,100
One can simply say that releasing CO2 should simply cost money.

437
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:03,600
Due to this things which produce a lot of CO2 and thus create a lot of economical damage would bought less because they would be more expensive.

438
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,900
On the other hand companies would have a much larger incentive for developing and providing new products which produce little CO2.

439
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,400
The scientists showed several times that this would have a positive effect.

440
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Very many German associations are supporting this and even economists and finance experts are finding this great.

441
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,300
More then 40 countries have this yet.

442
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:27,900
For example Great Britain. This helped them having the CO2 emissions at a level than hundred years ago.

443
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
So this sounds cool.

444
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Does the CDU implements this?

445
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
No.

446
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,000
How can the climate situation be summarized?

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,100
CDU and SPD are failing on their own goals.

448
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,900
Other countries want to accelerate but the CDU says they don't want that.

449
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,500
Furthermore SPD and CDU have shredded thousands of jobs in the renewable energy industries.

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,600
And like we've just seen the RWE and CDU dudes are shifting money to each other for keeping coal power artificially at life.

451
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,800
And what says the scientific community to the tack of CDU and SPD?

452
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,800
(Quaschning) We have to rapidly increase the speed of the German climate protection efforts by a factor of 5.

453
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:11,900
That's not only the perception of this one professor but he is talking there for an initiative of over 26,000 German-speaking scientists. * Signatures* 

454
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
I even didn't know that we have so many scientists.

455
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,600
And they all say that the current tack of SPD and CDU is much too slow. * The current efforts are far from being enough. *

456
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,200
And if we don't change this stark, not only a bit, but stark, than the future of the young generation and all future generations is fucked up. * Without profound and consequent changes is their future at danger.  - Over 26,000 German-speaking scientists *

457
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,400
There are also open letters of thousands of experts in the international arena saying exact the same. * (left) Would take more than one hour to show all - (bottom) 15,000 international scientists * 

458
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:41,600
The professionals, the experts all agree that the tack of SPD and CDU is not a minor defect but will cost us our future. * "Environmental goals of the sustainability strategy are in danger of being missed." *

459
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,300
This isn't about somebody has a different political view from mine. * "There is an urgent need for a new approach which sustains the system of our earth." *

460
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,900
No. This is about this both parties ignoring extremely good proven scientific knowledge. * "If we maintain the current tack of yearly emissions, we must abruptly drastically decrease our emissions to 0 if the CO2 budget will be depleted [in 8 years]." *

461
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:59,600
Ignoring urgent warnings of thousands of experts and in return doing a future and environment destroying politic which holds life in contempt. * "Until now a transformation [...] has only a very limited took part. Further basic changes are necessary." *

462
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Against the health of the population, against our life, and for the benefit of any large corporations. * "Such a half-heartedness will lead to nothing, not more than disenchantment with politics. Even the own goals are missed."  - German Institute for Economic Research *

463
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,800
During my investigations I looked through hundreds of scientific investigations. * "The train to an CO2-free future for Germany derailed."- Prof. Kemfert,  Professor of  Energy Economics *

464
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,400
I didn't find any expert who said: Yes, we are on a good track and all will go well. Not a fucking single one. * -  special report of the IPCC (consensus of > 6000  studies) *

465
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,500
Before this I wasn't aware how stark this parties doing politics against expert opinions. * "The defined goals won't be reached without massive and rapid additional efforts."  - Federal Environment Agency *

466
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Because of this one can say that the current tack of CDU and SPD will destroy our life and our future. * "It is simply said 'Let us do' and this 'Let us do' didn't worked the last 30 years." - Volker Quaschning, Professor of Renewable Energy Systems *

467
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,500
And that's not an angry exaggerated slogan but the consensus of thousands of experts supported by countless  scientific investigations. * "Grow the fuck up! [...]  This is an actual crisis, got it?"  - Scientist Bill Nye *

468
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,100
That was a pretty downer, wasn't it?

469
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,200
For cheering up we look at some members of the CDU which didn't have a plan of their job.

470
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Let's go.

471
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,800
* Pure incompetence *

472
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,700
The thing is: If you have a job, you should have a plan of this job.

473
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:55,000
If you don't know or don't can to things which are necessary for your your than one calls you incompetent.
